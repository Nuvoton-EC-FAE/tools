# Coredump Analyzer

This Python script analyzes and strips coredump files, providing detailed information about memory regions and other relevant data.

## Features

- Parse and analyze coredump files
- Extract memory regions and their details
- Strip unnecessary data from coredump files
- Verbose output option for detailed analysis
- Save processed coredump to a new file

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

```
python debug.py <input_file> [<output_file>] [-v] --strip
```

### Arguments

- `input_file`: Path to the input coredump file (required)
- `output_file`: Path to save the processed coredump file (optional, default: `<input_file_name>_final.<extension>`)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output (optional)
- `--strip`: Strip the coredump file (required to execute the workflow)

## Coredump Structure

The script expects the coredump file to have the following structure:

1. Main Header (ID: 'ZE')
2. Architecture Header (ID: 'A')
3. Memory Sections (ID: 'M')

Each section has its own header and data format.

## Output

The script provides information about:

- Main header details
- Pointer size
- Architecture header details
- Memory regions (start address, end address, size, and first 16 bytes of data)


## Note

This script is designed for specific coredump formats. Ensure your coredump file matches the expected structure for accurate analysis.
